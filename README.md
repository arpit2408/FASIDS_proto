Fire Ant Spatial Information and Decision Support
===

## Synopsis

This readme.md is about Ant Spatial Information and Decision Support (FASIDS). This web project is funded by Texas A&M AgriLife Extension, and is supervised by Prof. Robert Coulson at Department of Entomology. Bowei Liu has been responsible for the implementation of this version of FASIDS since October 2016. This web project aims at facilitating management of imported fire ants. It has mainly three purposes: 
  1. Landscape tool in fire ant management 
  2. Fire ant management knowledge base 
  3. Fire ant management Knowledge sharing

At the time of writing (04/14/2016), This project adopts [MEAN stack](http://blog.mongodb.org/post/49262866911/the-mean-stack-mongodb-expressjs-angularjs-and), and can be hosted in Linux server or in Windows server having IIS with [IISNODE](https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode).

The project can be visited at http://fasids.tamu.edu/node/fasids.

The edge version of project is currently hosted at [OpenShift Redhat cloud](http://fasids-u7yhjm.rhcloud.com/) for testing purpose. 

## Features and Usage

Mark to be treated area on map, put land usuage, memo, and fire ant mound denstiy to it, and save it to your profile.

##### Start Drawing
Click the uppoermost button on left tool panel. Click on map to place a vertex. To finish drawing, just click on the first vertex of polyline. Then one polygon will apear on map.
To place one hold in one **closed** polygon, just click the "DRAW HOLE" button in left panel, and left click inside the polygon in which you would like to place one hole. You can place multiple holes inside one polygon. 

##### Edit Shape and Remove Holes
Right click on one vertex, one small menu will pop up, select function you want. 

##### Set Properties
Click the "SET PROPERTIES" button on left tool panel, then click on the polygon you want to set property. One modal will pop out. Enter properties and save changes.

##### Save polygon and see result.
Click "SAVE & SEE RESULT" button. Similarly, you need to again click on the polygon you want to save. Browser will take you to result page for the saved polygon. Some fire ant products will be listed below the map, showing the amount of usage.

##### Retrieve the polygon and edit again
Log into your account, enter user dashboard. Your polygon will be listed there.
You can click the "edit" enter edit mode of this polygon again.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
